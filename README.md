Super Tic-Tac-Toe


in terms of working with the functionality of the game,
you got three files to worry about:

```
[root]
--app.js
----modules/gameapi.js
----public/scripts/homepage.js
```


everything else is basic HTML or CSS

To begin the SuperTTT NodeJS use the following commands after installing nodejs, npm, and nodemon (optional, only for devs):
...
npm start
npm test
...
